# Lexical Scope and Formal Parameters in terms of bound and free variables

## Free and Bound variables

When a procedure has a set of formal parameters that
allows its users to provide arguments for its specific
task, the parameters become _bound_ variables. This
means that the variables, as long as its referenced
correctly despite renaming them, have a scope
**within** procedure's body and not outside of it. This
allows to isolate the variables from outside one unless
you capture the name that already exists outside of
procedure. To give an example, look at this:
```scheme
(define (square x) (* x x))

(define (random-sum x y)
        (+ (square x) y))
```
As you can see, `random-sum` and `sqaure` procedures
share a common parameter of `x`, but the **meaning** of
it is different for each procedure. This is because
mechanism of bounding a variable to a procedure allows
the parameters to have their own value without
interferring upper callers' (i.e. procedures in higher
call stacks) parameters that have the same name.
Otherwise, the procedures would have to take care of
which version of `x` parameter to use!

Free variables, on the other hand, are types of variables
that exist independently outside of a procedure's definition
if it references them in the first place. These free
variables will have a value, whether a primitive data or a
named compound procedure, being assigned to them outside of
any procedure defintions. These variables act as an
_abstract procedures_ because procedures that use them don't
know their exact implementation but they have an expectation
of its behaviour that is part of an evaluation within them.
In other words, they act as **black boxes** for the
procedures as well as dependency of them due to their
specific functional purposes.

# Lexical Scope

Lexical scope is a space where a set of symbols (i.e.
names of primitive data and procedures) are stored and
the **way** they get accessed by symbol referencing
within procedures. In other words, this provides an
alternative way to specify how sub-procedures reference
free or bound variables.

For example, imagine that you have this procedure:
```scheme
(define (sum x y z)
        (
           (define (add x y) (+ x y))
           (+ (add x y) z)
        )
)
```
where you have a sub-procedured defined to add two
variables. Make notice that `x` and `y` variables are
formal paramteres within `add` procedure and when
invoking it, its parameters get bound to add definition
for it to access the values. However, what if one
defined the same procedure but like this:

```scheme
(define (sum x y z)
        (
           (define (add) (+ x y))
           (+ (add) z)
        )
)
```
As you can see here, the `add` procedure doesn't
specify formal paramters but its body has references
`x` and `y` variables. This is a power of the lexical scope
where sub-procedures, which are defined within
a *wrapping* procedure, can access variables by looking
at each level of symbol name space.
