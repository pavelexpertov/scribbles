# Lexical Scope and Formal Parameters in terms of bound and free variables

There is a concept that describes two types of variables:
_free_ and _bound_ ones.

For example, when you define a procedure with parameters,
the parameters are formal and will be used in a
procedure call via its body definition. These
paremeters would be called **free** variables since
they can be changed as long as the body definition can
keep updating its references to it. This is because
they do not impact code outside of the body definition.

Whereas a bound variable is a type of variable that
relates to a value, whether it's a primitive value or a
named procedure, that is outside of the procedure's
body definition and thus, it relies upon it as a
dependency. This is because the bound variable has been
defined outside the body definition and it doesn't have
a jurisdiction on it.

This introduces a concept called black box
where you can isolate a given variable's definition as
long as it satisfies an expected behaviour for the
dependent definition. 

Lexical scope is a space where a set of symbols (i.e.
names of primitive data and procedures) are stored and
the **way** they get accessed by symbol referencing
within procedures. In other words, this provides an
alternative way to specify how sub-procedures reference
free or bound variables.

For example, imagine that you have this procedure:
```scheme
(define (sum x y z)
        (
           (define (add x y) (+ x y))
           (+ (add x y) z)
        )
)
```
where you have a sub-procedured defined to add two
variables. Make notice that `x` and `y` variables are
formal paramteres within `add` procedure and when
invoking it, its parameters get bound to add definition
for it to access the values. However, what if one
defined the same procedure but like this:

```scheme
(define (sum x y z)
        (
           (define (add) (+ x y))
           (+ (add) z)
        )
)
```
As you can see here, the `add` procedure doesn't
specify formal paramters but its body has references
`x` and `y` variables. This is a power of the lexical scope
where sub-procedures, which are defined within
a *wrapping* procedure, can access variables by looking
at each level of symbol name space.
