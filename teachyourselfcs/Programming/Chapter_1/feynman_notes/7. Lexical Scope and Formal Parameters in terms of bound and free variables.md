# Lexical Scope and Formal Parameters in terms of bound and free variables

There is a concept that describes two types of variables:
_free_ and _bound_ ones.

For example, when you define a procedure with parameters,
the parameters are formal and will be used in a
procedure call via its body definition. These
paremeters would be called **free** variables since
they can be changed as long as the body definition can
keep updating its references to it. This is because
they do not impact code outside of the body definition.

Whereas a bound variable is a type of variable that
relates to a value, whether it's a primitive value or a
named procedure, that is outside of the procedure's
body definition and thus, it relies upon it as a
dependency. This is because the bound variable has been
defined outside the body definition and it doesn't have
a jurisdiction on it.
This introduces a concept called black box
where you can isolate a given variable's definition as
long as it satisfies an expected behaviour for the
dependent definition.
