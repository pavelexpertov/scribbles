# Evaluation of Combinations
The Scheme's interpreter has a set of rules to
follow when it comes to evaluation combinations with
various expressions. The evaluation steps are:
1. Evaluate the left most sub-expression and bring its
   definition (whether it be a procedure or primitive
   value).
2. evaluate the following sub-expression. Start at step 1.
3. Once all sub-expressions are evaluated, execute
   left-most sub-expression (i.e. an operator) with the
   rest of sub-expressions (i.e. operands).

The point to notice about this rule is that a second
step tends to call itself. Thus, the evaluation
execution has a recursive nature!

Look at the following example: `(+ 20 (* 2 2))`. It
looks very obvious that the answer will be 24, but how
does the evaluation of the combination's
sub-expressions look like? If you follow the outline
rules, first and second sub-expressions will just
evaluate procedure's definition and number `24`. But
for the combination of `(* 2 2)`, the rule will invoke
itself and start going back to step 1 to evaluate it.
Thus, the evaluation can be represented as a tree (a
hierchical tree in fact):
