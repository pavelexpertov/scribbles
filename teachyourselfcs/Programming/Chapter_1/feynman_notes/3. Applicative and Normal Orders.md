# Applicative and Normal Order

There are two ways that Scheme's combinations and its sub-expressions
get evaluated in terms of order of evaluation process
on the expressions and their reductions.

TL;DR:
- **Applicative Order** -- It is an order that
  evaluates sub-expressions and reduces them to an
  evaluated value as the parser reaches each
  sub-expression within a combination.
