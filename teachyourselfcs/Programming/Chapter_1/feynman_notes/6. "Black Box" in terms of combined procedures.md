# "Black Box in terms of combined procedures"

Black box term is used to characterise combined
procedures such that one doesn't have to assume what's
inside of it.

For example, let's say we have a set of defined procedures:
```scheme
(define (square x)
        (* x x))
(define (sum-of-squares x y)
        (+ (square x) (square y)))
```
The `square` procedure can be treated as a black box
that only takes one value and has a meaning that it
will return a squared one. This allows programmers to
assume the meaning of the procedure without knowing
what it means. In fact, the procedure's definition
could be anything for as long as it promises to return
a squared value.
