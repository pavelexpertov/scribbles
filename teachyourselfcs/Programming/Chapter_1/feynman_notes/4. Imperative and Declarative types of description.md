There are two types of descriptions: Declarative and imperative types

Declarative type is to describe what it is.

Imperative type is to describe how it is done.

An example of declarative description is a mathematical expression like
`y = 2 + x`. It describes an equation where for every
value of x, there will be an added number of `2`.
Basically, it describes an equation that produces a
linear line that's strongly positive correlated.
However, it does not tell you how to add the number `2`
to a given `x` value.

This is where the imperative description comes in. For
example, this Python code instrucs the interpreter to
perform the above equation:
```python
def calculate_y(x):
    return x + 2

print('Given x of 4, y is', calculate_y(4))
# Output is "Given x of 4, y is 6"
```
`calculate_y` function has instructions to describe
how this can be done.
